## About Web development 

Web development is the process of designing, building, and maintaining websites. It involves a combination of front-end and back-end development to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Front-end development focuses on the visual and user-facing aspects of a website using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development, on the other hand, involves server-side scripting and database management to power the functionalities of a website. Web development is crucial in today's digital age as a majority of businesses and individuals have a web presence to reach and engage with a wider audience

## Talk Included

- ### Front End Web development
- ### Version Control System 
- ### Back End Web Development
- ### Why do we need a community

## Salary of a Web Developer 

The average salary of a web developer in India is around ‚Çπ5-7 lakhs per year, with top earners making over ‚Çπ10-12 lakhs. In the United States, the average salary for a web developer is around $75,000 per year, with top earners making over $120,000.

## Why App Development ?

  - High demand
  - Career opportunity
  - Start-up Potential 
  - Flexibility 
  - Constant Learning 

## Platforms 

   - Native - Specific for a particular operating system like Android or Ios .
   - Cross Platform - Used to create App for more that one operating system with a single codebase .

## Native 
- Native app development is the process of building apps specifically for a particular operating system (OS), such as iOS or Android.
- Native apps are built using programming languages specific to the OS, such as Swift for iOS and Java for Android.
- Native apps are faster and more reliable than cross-platform apps, as they can take full advantage of the device's hardware and software capabilities.
- Native apps can be sold through app stores, and have the ability to receive updates and push notifications.

## Cross-Platform

- Cross-platform app development involves building an app that can run on multiple operating systems, such as iOS and Android.
- Cross-platform apps are built using technologies such as React Native, Xamarin, or Flutter, which allow for code reuse across different platforms.
- This can result in faster development times and lower costs compared to native app development.
- Cross-platform apps also have the advantage of reaching a wider audience, as they can be released on multiple app stores.
- However, cross-platform apps may not have the same performance or access to device features as native apps, and may not provide as seamless of an experience.

## Facts

- As of January 2021, Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the world, with a market share of over 80%.
- Android has a large user base, with over 2.5 billion active devices as of September 2020.
iOS has a market share of around 15-20% in the global smartphone market
- Android apps can be developed on macOS, Windows, and Linux, using various integrated development environment (IDE) such as Android Studio.
- iOS apps are developed using Xcode, which is only available on macOS.

## What is programming ?

Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer software. It involves using programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, to write instructions that tell a computer what to do. These instructions, also known as code, are executed by the computer to perform specific tasks. Programming is a fundamental aspect of computer science and enables individuals to create software applications, websites, and other types of computer programs. It requires a combination of logical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. By learning how to program, individuals can develop their ability to think computationally and create innovative solutions to real-world problems.

## Programming Languages

We communicate with computers with help of programming languages. These are languages that the computer understands.

Here are a few popular ones:
- C++
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript

## What is DSA?

- DSA stands for ‚ÄúData Structures and Algorithms‚Äù.

- It is a branch of Computer Science that deals with creating machine-efficient computer programs.

- ‚ÄúData Structure‚Äù refers to storage of data and ‚ÄúAlgorithm‚Äù is the procedure to solve a problem.

# System Design 
**"Speaker = Kushagra Agarwal "**
Speaker stars of by giving a brief about himself and his achievements .
## What is System Design ?
System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves creating a blueprint or a model of the system, including both hardware and software components. The main objective of system design is to ensure that the system is efficient, scalable, maintainable, and meets the requirements of the users.

In software development, system design involves defining the architecture of the software application, identifying the components and modules, and determining how they will interact with each other. In hardware design, it involves specifying the hardware components and their interactions, as well as defining the electrical and mechanical interfaces.

System design is a critical stage in the development process, as it sets the foundation for the development, testing, and deployment of the system. A well-designed system will have fewer bugs and be easier to maintain, resulting in lower costs and a more reliable end product.

## What is a server ?

A server is a computer system that provides shared resources or services to other devices on a network. Servers are typically used to host applications, store and manage data, and provide centralized services to clients. They can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as web hosting, email, file sharing, database management, and more.

Servers are typically more powerful and have larger storage capacity than regular computers, as they are designed to handle multiple requests and perform complex tasks. They can be deployed in physical or virtual form, and can be located on-premises or in the cloud.

Servers are essential components of computer networks, providing the infrastructure necessary to support applications and services. They help ensure the reliability, scalability, and security of the network, and play a key role in enabling businesses to operate more efficiently and effectively.

## How meta handes billions of users ?
Handling billions of users effectively requires a robust and scalable system. Here are some key points to consider when addressing this challenge:

- Scalability: Breaking down the system into smaller components that can be distributed across multiple servers, allowing for a larger volume of users.

- Load balancing: Distributes incoming traffic evenly across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

- Data management: Utilizing efficient data storage and management systems, such as databases and caching technologies, to handle large amounts of data.

- Robust infrastructure: Having a secure and reliable infrastructure that can handle the demands of billions of users.

- Monitoring and maintenance: Regular monitoring and maintenance of the system to ensure that it continues to operate optimally and resolve any issues in a timely manner.

By combining these key points, meta is able to handle billions of users, providing fast, reliable, and secure online communities.
